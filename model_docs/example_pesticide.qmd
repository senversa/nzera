## DEMONSTRATION MODEL ONLY

**THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED DEMONSTRATION MODEL FOR TEACHING PURPOSES.**

This model uses fictitious calculations and should **NOT** be used for:
- Actual ecological assessments
- Environmental management decisions
- Regulatory compliance
- Conservation planning
- Scientific research

This model exists solely to demonstrate the NZERA framework's capability to handle multiple ecological models.
:::

## Overview

This is an example pesticide exposure and risk assessment model for demonstration purposes.

## Purpose

This model demonstrates:

1. **Framework Capabilities:** Shows how the NZERA framework handles multiple models
2. **Multi-domain Support:** Illustrates ecological risk assessment alongside toxicology
3. **Interface Consistency:** Uses the same `_run()`, `_metadata()`, `_schema()` pattern

## Background

This model is a fictitious example created solely for educational purposes. It does not represent any real-world pesticide or assessment methodology.

## Equations and/or Conceptual Model

The model estimates risk score based on pesticide concentration and species-specific toxicity factors using the equation:

\[\text{risk\_score} = \text{concentration} \times \text{toxicity\_factor}\]


## Inputs

### Required Parameters


| Parameter | Type | Description | Units |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------|
| species | character | Species identifier | - |
| concentration | numeric | Pesticide concentration in water | mg/L |
| toxicity_factor | numeric | Toxicity factor derived from toxicity data | dimensionless |


## Model Outputs


| Parameter | Type | Description | Units |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------|
| risk_score | numeric | Calculated risk score for the species | dimensionless |


## Methods

The model uses simplified assumptions to calculate exposure based on application rates and environmental factors.

## Assumptions

- Uniform application
- Standard environmental conditions
- No degradation during assessment period

## Assumptions, Limitations, and Decisions

- Simplified model for demonstration
- Not validated for regulatory use

## References and Data Sources

None - example model only.


## Development Log

- 2025-11-16 Initial model development



## Validation and Sensitivity Analysis

- Not applicable for this demonstration model.


## Examples

```{r}
# library(nzera)
#
# input <- data.frame(
#    species        = c("Fish", "Crab"),
#    concentration  = c(2.5, 1.1),
#    toxicity_factor= c(0.8, 1.3)
# )
#
# results <- model_example_pesticide_run(input)
```
